# UNOISENIM


`unoisenim` is a high-performance Nim library designed for bioinformatics tasks, specifically focusing on amplicon sequencing data processing. It provides efficient implementations of key algorithms such as UNOISE for sequence clustering, UCHIME2 for chimera detection, and SINTAX for taxonomic classification.
